A Words With Friends bot

wwfbot is a Python notebook that tracks the state of a Words With Friends board and, given the letters in the player's rack, searches for the move that results in the maximum possible score. Currently, it can not deal with blanks in the player's rack since it would take too long to decide on a move, but will factor in blanks on the board when calculating word score.
